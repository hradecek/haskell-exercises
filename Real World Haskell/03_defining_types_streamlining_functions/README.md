# 3 Defining Types, Streamlining Functions
1.
Write the converse of `fromList` for the `List` type: a function that takes a `List a` and generates a `[a]`.

2.
Define a tree type that has only one constructor, like our Java example. Instead of the `Empty` constructor, use the `Maybe` type to refer to node's children.

# 3 Defining Types, Streamlining Functions
1. Write the converse of `fromList` for the `List` type: a function that takes a `List a`
and generates a `[a]`.

2. Define a tree type that has only one constructor, like our Java example.
Instead of the `Empty` constructor, use the `Maybe` type to refer to node's children.

3. Write a function that computes the number of elements in a list. To test it, ensure
that it gives the same answers as the standard length function.

4. Add a type signature for your function to your source file. To test it, load the source
file into `ghci` again.

5. Write a function that computes the mean of a list, i.e., the sum of all elements in
the list divided by its length. (You may need to use the fromIntegral function to
convert the length of the list from an integer into a floating-point number.)

6. Turn a list into a palindrome; i.e., it should read the same both backward and
forward. For example, given the list `[1,2,3]`, your function should return
`[1,2,3,3,2,1]`.

7. Write a function that determines whether its input list is a palindrome.

8. Create a function that sorts a list of lists based on the length of each sublist. (You
may want to look at the `sortBy` function from the `Data.List` module.)

9. Define a function that joins a list of lists together using a separator value:
```
-- file: ch03/Intersperse.hs
intersperse :: a -> [[a]] -> [a]
```

10. The separator should appear between elements of the list, but it should not follow
the last element. Your function should behave as follows:
```
ghci> :load Intersperse
[1 of 1] Compiling Main ( Intersperse.hs, interpreted )
Ok, modules loaded: Main.
ghci> intersperse ',' []
""
ghci> intersperse ',' ["foo"]
"foo"
ghci> intersperse ',' ["foo","bar","baz","quux"]
"foo,bar,baz,quux"
```

11. Using the binary tree type that we defined earlier in this chapter, write a function
that will determine the height of the tree. The height is the largest number of hops
from the root to an `Empty`. For example, the tree `Empty` has height zero; `Node "x"
Empty Empty` has height one; `Node "x" Empty (Node "y" Empty Empty)` has height
two; and so on.

12. Consider three two-dimensional points, `a`, `b`, and `c`. If we look at the angle formed
by the line segment from `a` to `b` and the line segment from `b` to `c`, it turns left, turns
right, or forms a straight line. Define a `Direction` data type that lets you represent
these possibilities.

13. Write a function that calculates the turn made by three two-dimensional points
and returns a `Direction`.

14. Define a function that takes a list of two-dimensional points and computes the
direction of each successive triple. Given a list of points `[a,b,c,d,e]`, it should
begin by computing the turn made by `[a,b,c]`, then the turn made by `[b,c,d]`,
then `[c,d,e]`. Your function should return a list of `Direction`.

13. Using the code from the preceding three exercises, implement Grahamâ€™s scan algorithm
for the convex hull of a set of 2D points. You can find good description
of what a [convex hull](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull) is, and how the
[Graham scan algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_scan) should work,
on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/).

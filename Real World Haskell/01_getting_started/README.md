# 1 Getting started
1. Enter the following expressions into ghci. What are their types?
 - `5 + 8`
 - `3 * 5 + 8`
 - `2 + 4`
 - `(+) 2 4`
 - `sqrt 16`
 - `succ 6`
 - `succ 7`
 - `pred 9`
 - `pred 8`
 - `sin (pi / 2)`
 - `truncate pi`
 - `round 3.5`
 - `round 3.4`
 - `floor 3.7`
 - `ceiling 3.3`

2. From `ghci`, type `:?` to print some help. Define a variable, such as `let x = 1`, and then type `:show bindings`.

What do you see?

3. The `words` function counts the number of words in a string. Modify the `WC.hs` example in order to count the number of words in a file.

4. Modify the `WC.hs` example again, in order to print the number of characters in a file.
